### wifi isn't working

This surfaces as the wifi card showing up in `lspci` but not in `nmcli d` or `ip addr`. It happens because of windows' fast startup feature which is enabled by default. Basically shutting down your computer from windows won't always fully shut down the computer, and sometimes windows will keep hold of some devices including the wifi card. This means that linux can't use the wifi card unless windows relinquishes control of it. To fix, disable fast startup in windows.

### system fails to boot display server after system update

Part 1 was to install xf86-video-fbdev as per an warning/error in the xorg log, and part 2 was installing lib32-mesa-amber to address the AIGLX i965 error, then I could get into i3 again.

Apparently Mesa dropped mainline support for older driver in December 2021, but will maintain support in the amber branch. Kinda wish the mesa package would auto-detect your video driver and recommend switching to the amber branch when upgrading.
